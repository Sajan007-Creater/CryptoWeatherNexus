# Redux Implementation Summary

## Requirement Met

✅ The project now fully implements Redux with Redux Thunk middleware for async operations.

## Implementation Details

1. **Core Redux Packages Added**:
   - `redux`: Core Redux library
   - `react-redux`: React bindings for Redux
   - `@reduxjs/toolkit`: Official, opinionated Redux toolset
   - `redux-thunk`: Middleware for async actions (included in Redux Toolkit)

2. **Redux Store Structure**:
   - Created a centralized Redux store in `src/store/index.ts`
   - Implemented typed hooks for use with TypeScript in `src/store/hooks.ts`
   - Added proper type definitions in `src/store/types.ts`

3. **Feature Slices**:
   - Weather slice (`weatherSlice.ts`): Manages weather data state
   - Crypto slice (`cryptoSlice.ts`): Manages cryptocurrency data state
   - News slice (`newsSlice.ts`): Manages news article data state

4. **Async Actions with Redux Thunk**:
   - Implemented async data fetching with `createAsyncThunk`
   - Added proper loading states, error handling, and success cases
   - Simulated API responses with promises for demonstration

5. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Created custom feature hooks like `useWeather` for easier usage of Redux state

6. **Component Integration**:
   - Created example components that use Redux state
   - Updated the main `App.tsx` to include the Redux Provider
   - Demonstrated prop drilling avoidance with centralized state

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example of dispatching an async action:

```tsx
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../store/hooks';
import { fetchWeatherByCity } from '../store/slices/weatherSlice';

function WeatherComponent() {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
  const { currentWeather, loading, error } = useAppSelector(state => state.weather);

  const handleSearch = async (cityName) => {
    try {
      await dispatch(fetchWeatherByCity(cityName)).unwrap();
      // Success handling
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component UI using the Redux state */}
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
      {currentWeather && <p>Weather for {currentWeather.cityName}: {currentWeather.temperature}°C</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation fulfills the requirement for Redux with async middleware by implementing a complete Redux setup with Redux Toolkit and Redux Thunk for handling asynchronous operations.
